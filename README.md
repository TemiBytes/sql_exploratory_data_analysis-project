# Exploratory Data Analysis Project

This repository contains a collection of SQL scripts that answer various analytical questions in a business context, including data segmentation, changes over time, cumulative performance, part-to-whole analysis, and report generation, which are very useful for business intelligence and can be visualized using tools like Power BI.

You can check out my [previous project](https://github.com/TemiBytes/sql-data-warehouse-project) for a detailed explanation on how I created the data warehouse for this EDA project using a Data Medallion Architecture
